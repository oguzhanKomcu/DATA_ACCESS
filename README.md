# DATA_ACCESS
I have created my examples of data access topics in this repository. I have examples and projects on topics such as entity framework , data first , code first , Orm , database creation.

## ORM (Object Relational Mapping)
It is a tool that acts as a bridge between a relational database and object-oriented programming (OOP). This bridge is a structure where we use our object models to manage our information in the relational database. In short, it is a framework developed by Microsoft that connects our objects to the database and exchanges data for us.

## ENTIY FRAMEWORK
By using LINQ (Language Integrated Query) queries with the Entity framework, we have a powerful query on objects. The services provided by the Entity framework are mainly change tracking, identity resolution, and query translation.The main purpose of the Entity framework is to enable the application developer to focus on the application side without being too busy with data operations. As a very simple example, we developers are entirely responsible for opening and closing a connection in classic ADO.NET applications. However, when you use the entity framework, you do not interfere with such operations. You prepare your query and send it to the database via the entity framework.
